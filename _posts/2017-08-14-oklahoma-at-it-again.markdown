As a native Oklahoman, we know this story all too well. An Oklahoma man has been arrested in connection with a plot to blow up a building in downtown OKC.

>"Jerry Drake Varnell, 23, allegedly attempted to bomb a bank with a device similar to the one responsible the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building, but an undercover FBI agent stood between him and his plans, authorities said.
>Varnell was arrested in the early morning hours Monday by the FBI, the Joint Terrorism Task Force and other law enforcement officers after the alleged attempt to blow up the building failed.

>The efforts of the FBI agent led Varnell to build a vehicle-based bomb that ended up being inert. The bomb failed to detonate when he dialed the number to explode it in front of the BancFirst building.

>The FBI undercover agent started meeting with Varnell in late May and helped him assemble his bomb, the complaint said. During their meetings, Varnell admitted adhering to "III% ideology ... wanting to start the next revolution."

>The public was not in danger, authorities said." - News Channel 10 Oklahoma 

The FBI had been investigating Varnell for months and had "helped" him assemble and load the bomb. Uh...so the FBI had just been helping this guy for months? Just a few dedicated hours every day to helping some homegrown terrorism? Hopefully they tried to have someone send him to counciling rather than just further his plot of destruction. In conversation you think they were ever like, maybe there's a more contructive way to show your disdain for government, or was it just like yeah you should blow that shit up. Because if it's the latter than maybe we should review our FBI policy on helping terrorists.

Anyway, once the van was parked in an alley outside the building, Jerry called a number thinking it would detonate the bomb. 
I assume once the bomb didn't go off he was like "Fuckin Tmobile" or something like that, but instead it was really the FBI saving the day. I'm sure he dialed again with no response, we've all been there Jerry. Then he had to sit there and think, is 3 calls too desperate? Maybe a text...nah nah I'm good, she'll call back when she sees it. 

If you didn't know OKC has already had a pretty awful bombing back in '95. This guy was actually inspired by that. Apparently he was angry at the government. I bet it was taxes, or maybe the DMV line.

Varnell is charged with attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate commerce. If convicted, he could recieve a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a minimum sentence of five years.
