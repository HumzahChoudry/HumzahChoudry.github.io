If you're a defender and you see Cristiano cutting into the box, form tackle him. Wrap him up low and drive your legs. It's the only chance you have at stopping him right now.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored another beauty. You know those shots so perfect that the goalie doesnt even bother trying to save it. It's the same move and finish as he had against Barcelona a week ago. Cut in, then hit'em with the ole RB + B. Must be playing FIFA '09 because it seems to be working every time.
