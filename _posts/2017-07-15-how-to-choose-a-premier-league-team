So with the Premier League coming back in a month or so my excitement is building. Unfrotunately I am the only one amongst my friends who likes soccer and I think a large part of that is due to them not having a team to root for. So I'm compiling a short list of teams and why you would want to root for this team. I also wrote some notable players down that way you can be like "Oh yeah I like that guy" or "Fack that guy and that team".

Arsenal - If you have ever said "this is how the game should be played" Arsenal is probably your team. They play some old school pass a bunch beautiful soccer. They're loyal to their players and their coach. A real old school team. I'd compare them to OU, they're always in the mix, but never win championships.
  Notable Players: Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Thierry Henry

Chelsea - This team reminds me of Alabama. They're very hatable, but they get 'ships. They used to have a cunt coach (Mourinho) a cunt striker (Costa) and a cunt defender (John Terry) but they're all gone now. Their owner is a Russian mobster if you're into that. 
  Notable Players: Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard

Liverpool - Used to be good, just getting back into the mix. They've got a new coach who goes nuts everytime they score. It's awesome. They're a fun team but wont be winning a championship anytime soon. Comparable to 
  Notable Players: Countinho, Jordan Henderson, Steven Gerrard

Manchester City - New kids on the block. They've got hella money and they spend it. I would compare these guys to 
  Notable Players: Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling, David Silva
  
Manchester United - Everyones favorite team. They have a lot of the most notable players ever and a lot of championships. I'd compare them to the Yankees.
  Notable Players: Wayne Rooney, Paul Pogba, David Beckham
