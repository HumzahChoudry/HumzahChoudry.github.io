So I was listening to music on YouTube, as I do because I'm too broke to afford Spotify. I was listening to Redbone by Childish Gambino and I saw something peculiar. One of those things on the internet that you just have to click on. The title read "What Redbone would sound like sung by Kermit the Frog". Obviously I clicked on it and...well, I wasn't disappointed.

The video is great but it led me down a rabbithole. Next thing I new I was listening to "What Redbone would sound like if sung by Cleveland Brown" and  "What Redbone would sound like if it was schwifty".

I don't know who comes up with this stuff but I love them. 

Nothing beats the OG Kermit version but here are other versions I would recommend:
<ul>
<li>Childish Trumpino - Red Bing</li>
<li>REDBONE BUT IT'S SUNG BY STEWIE GRIFFIN</li>
<li>What Redbone would sound like if my longest yeah boy ever lasted for 10 mins <--- This one actually made me stop listening to versions, it's when I knew I had gone too far.</li>
</ul>
