For all 10 people who care, we are kicked off the EPL season today. It was an amazing opener featuring Arsenal and Leichester City. 

It was a back and forth game that ended with Arsenal scoring 2 goals in the last 10 minutes to come from behind to win 4-3. Emotions were high. If you havent hopped on the EPL train yet its not too late. The season is young.
