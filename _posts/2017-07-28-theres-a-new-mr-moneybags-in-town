There's a new Mr. Moneybags in town and his name is Neymar da Silva Santos Junior (yes that is his full name and yes I had to look it up)
If Neymar was a restaurant on google maps he would be one of those restaurants you immediately back out of because it has too many $'s.

His transfer fee is a record breaking 222 million euros (~260 USD). Yeaaaah and that is just to have him released so PSG can sign him. 
We can only assume from here Neymar's contract will include a small province in France and rights to 1/4 of Qatar's oil reserves.

Regardless this starts a new era for both PSG and Barcelona. Who will Barca pick up to replace the 3 best player in the world? Time will tell (Countinho), all we know is they've money in the bank.
