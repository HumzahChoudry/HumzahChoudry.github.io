Did anyone else start a fantasy league 8-10 years ago and now regret it. Listen I love my friends, but they're shit heads. Trying to organize us to drink alcohol together is tough enough and we actually enjoy doing that.

Every year I have to go through the same bullshit with my friends. It starts out with a text reminding me that I am the god forsaken commissioner of our shit league. 

>"We playin fantasy this year"

>Fuck, yeah I guess I'll set it up

9 days passes by. I finally set up the league. I send out emails to the same email adressess every year, yet for some reason they all ask me what email I sent it to. Ok so post a list of emails. Check who's signed up, no one. 

A few days later 8/10 have signed up. The last 2 are what make this league some damn difficult. From sign up, to paying dues, to updating rosters they just can't keep up. For some reason they keep getting invited back to the league (mainly because I am too lazy to find replacements and too nice to kick them out).
