There are a lot of things in this world that bother me. Poverty, racism, having to take a dump while on the train but you're still 45 mins away from your house. 

Of all the things, the one I can't get over is the price of mozzerlla sticks. Who tf set these prices. I love mozz sticks. 
There's nothing more delicious to me than melty, stringy fried cheese. If it were up to me, faucets would pour out melted mozzeralla rather than water. That's including my shower.
That being said, I'll be god damned if I'm going to pay 12 dollars for 6 mozz sticks. The prices are outrageous. 
If I can somehow get 20 chicken nuggets for 5 bucks, there should be a way to get 50 mozz sticks for 5 bucks.

Look I even did the math, prices are per stick:
1 oz of cheese can cost ~30 cents
Breading, c'mon were talkin change here .07
Herbs, eh few pennies .05
Eggs, .10 even though I think it would be less
So we come out to 52 cents per stick.
DOLLAR MOZZ STICKS OR GFTO.

Let's strive for a better tomorrow, one where we don't pay 2 dollars for an ounce of delicious fried cheese.
