At what age is it inappropriate to not like someone for being sober? Because I'm not there yet.

I found myself asking this question last week. It was at a bar post kickball league. Every week after my team gets done crushing our opponents, we have a game of flip cup afterwards. All was going well and good until I realized one of the guys on the other team was pouring water in his cup. He had been pouring water in his cup the whole time. This guy was anchoring the team with sobriety. Now we all know a few drinks can help us get into our zone, but this game was way past everyones zone. Homie on the other hand has no zone. He only has one state of mind. Is that cheating? It's at least worth an in mind complaint.

I understand if you have tried it and didnt like it, or you have religious reasons etc etc. But for someone who has nothing holding them back and just never even dips their toes in the water? How are you that okay with your reality? What is so amazing about your life that you wouldnt even want to temporarily alter it to see if it can get better. Guys like that give me the creeps. Maybe I'm the one who's wrong. Me and the literally everyone else who isnt a sober weirdo.
