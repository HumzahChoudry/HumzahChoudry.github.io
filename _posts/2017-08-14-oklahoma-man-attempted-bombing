As if stuff wasn't crazy enough lately. An Oklahoma man has been arrested in connection with a plot to blow up a FirstBanc in downtown OKC.

The FBI had been investigating Jerry Drake Varnell, 23, for months and had "helped" him assemble and load the bomb. Uh...so the FBI had just been helping this guy for months? Hopefully they tried to have someone send him to counciling rather than just further his plot of destruction.
One the van was parked in an alley outside the building, Jerry called a number thinking it would detonate the bomb. 
I assume once the bomb didn't go off he was like "Fuckin Tmobile" or something like that, but instead it was really the FBI saving the day.

If you didn't know OKC has already had a pretty awful bombing back in '95. This guy was actually inspired by that. 

Varnell is charged with attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate commerce. If convicted, he could recieve a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a minimum sentence of five years.

Chalk one up for the good guys.
