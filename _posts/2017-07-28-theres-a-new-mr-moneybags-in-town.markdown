If Neymar was a restaurant on google maps he would be one of those restaurants you immediately back out of because it has too many $'s. I don't care how good the food is, I can't spend rent on a meal. His transfer fee is a record breaking 222 million euros (~260 USD). Yeaaaah and that is just to have him released so PSG can sign him. We can only assume from here Neymar's contract will include a small province in France and rights to 1/4 of Qatar's oil reserves. 

Regardless this starts a new era for both PSG and Barcelona. Who will Barca pick up to fill the void left by the 3 best player in the world? Early guesses involved Countinho (Liverpool), Dembele (Dortmund) and Dybala (Juve). Who would you want to see move to Barca?
