Have you ever heard that joke:

>You know what's 6 inches long, 2 inches wide and drives women wild?

>A dollar bill

You know what drives women more wild. 260 million dollar bills. Neymar has officially been released for a record breaking 222 million euros (~260 USD). Yeaaaah and that is just to have him released so PSG can sign him. We can only assume Neymar's contract will include a small province in France, a few Qatari oil fields and the rights to the Iron Throne.

If Neymar was a restaurant on google maps he would be one of those restaurants you immediately back out of because it has too many $'s. Like we all wish we could afford the quality and luxury of this place but we also can't spend a weekends rent in the Hamptons on lunch.

Regardless this starts a new era for both PSG and Barcelona. Who will Barca pick up to fill the void left by the 3 best player in the world? Early guesses involved Countinho (Liverpool), Dembele (Dortmund) and Dybala (Juve). Who would you want to see move to Barca?
