So it has begun. The AND 1 mixtape that will be Neymar's PSG highlights. I am thinking the name of the tape would be something like "Neymar Unleashed".
>(feel free to comment with your own title, comment section to be added later) 

The french league hasn't seen this kind of talent and the defenses are not ready. Like at all. His second game of the season was a cakewalk. He  notched 2 goals, 2 assists and drew a penalty. So involved with 5 goals. No biggie. It was capped off by this absolutely disgusting goal.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/0jddt/xckqow" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

He makes 4 professional defenmen look like B team bench players. He takes on nearly half the team. Before he scores he has the opportunity to turn inside, which 99% of players would do, only to fake it and finish the other way between two defenders.

That goal was not his only highlight, he had an intriguing corner as well. It was like a bullet pass that had backspin but was also rising while also swerving...it's hard to describe accurately. That pass set up for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeeqNPBiWU">spectacular finish from Layvin Kurzawa.</a>
 

Worth the fee.
