So it has begun. The AND 1 mixtape that will be Neymar's PSG highlights. I am thinking the name of the tape would be something like "Neymar Unleashed". 

The french league hasn't seen this kind of talent and the defenses are not ready. Like at all. His second game of the French League 1 season was a cakewalk. Neymar has 2 goals, 2 assists and drew a penalty. It was capped off by this absolutely disgusting goal.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/0jddt/xckqow" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

He literally made 4 professionally defenmen look like freshman B team players. He takes on half the team through purely being quicker and more coordinated. Before he scores he has the opportunity to turn inside, which 98% of players would do, only to fake it and finish the other way between two defenders.

That goal was not his only highlight, he had an intriguing corner as well, it was like a bullet that had backspin and was rising/swerving, anyways that set up for a spectacular finish from Layvin Kurzawa. 

Worth the paycheck.
