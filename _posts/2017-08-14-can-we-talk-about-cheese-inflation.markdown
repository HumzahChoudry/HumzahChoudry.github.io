There are a lot of things in this world that bother me. Poverty, corruption, that one hair in your beard that's longer than all the others. 

I've been thinking a lot lately about the price of mozzerlla sticks. What monster set these prices (Shkreli is that you?). There's nothing more delicious to me than melty, stringy, fried cheese. If it were up to me, faucets would pour running mozzeralla rather than water. That's including in my shower.
I love mozz sticks, but I'll be god damned if I'm going to pay 12 dollars for 6 mozz sticks. The prices are outrageous. 
If I can somehow get 20 chicken nuggets for 5 bucks, there should be a way to get 50 mozz sticks for the same price.

<p>Look I even did the math, prices are per stick:</p>

<p>1 oz of cheese costs ~30 cents</p>

<p>Breading, c'mon were talkin change here .07</p>

<p>Herbs, eh .05</p>

<p>Eggs, .10 even though I think it would be less</p>

<p>So we come out to 52 cents per stick. Paying $2 per stick is criminal. Do you really need to mark it up 400 percent? Are the 8 dollar "craft" beers not making you enough money? Craft beers just beers made by someone who decided to start brewing in 2011 anyway, they should be sold at a discount if anything. I'm getting off subject, all I'm saying is that we know we get upcharged on prices. $4 per Coors light, okay I'll live. $12 for a chicken sandwhich, fine I'll pay it. I just can't bring myself to purchase 1 mozzerlla stick for 2 dollars, I know I'm irresponsible with my money, but even I have my limits.</p>

DOLLAR MOZZ STICKS OR GFTO.
