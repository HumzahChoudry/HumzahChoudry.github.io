Huddlesfield Town, the newly promoted side, is enjoying wonderful start to their English campaign. After a goal by <a href="https://www.magicalquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Nux.jpg">Nux from Mad Max</a> aka Aaron Mooy, the Terriers were able secure a victory and start their campaign 2-0.

*Oh, what a day... what a lovely day!*

Now I'm not saying they're going to be the next Leichester City, but who doesn't love a good underdog team. The beauty of the Premier League is that at the end of the season we'll have to say bye to 3 teams. I'm afraid with strong showings from some of the newly promoted teams my secret second love Crystal Palace may be getting the boot at the end of the season.
