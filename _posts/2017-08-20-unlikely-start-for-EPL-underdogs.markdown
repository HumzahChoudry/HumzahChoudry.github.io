Huddlesfield Town, the newly promoted side has had a wonderful start to their English campaign. After a goal by Midfielder and assumed Nux from Mad Max cosplayer, Aaron Mooy the Terriers were able to hold on to start their campaign 2-0.

*Oh, what a day... what a lovely day!*

Now I'm not saying they're going to be the next Leichester City, but who doesn't love a good underdog team. The beauty of the Premier League is that at the end of the season we'll have to say bye to 3 teams. I am afraid with strong showings from some of the promoted teams my secret second love Crystal Palace may be getting the boot at the end of the season.
