For those of you who haven't heard yet DJ Khaled is back. His song with Rhianna 'Wild Thought' is a definite contender for song of the summer.

The question on my mind though is how many kids these days will notice that the guitar riff is from Carlos Santana's 'Maria Maria'
I'm willing to bet there's at least one or two kids out there thinking "Man DJ Khaled can shred on the guitar". Which is both hilarious and sad, my favorite kind of funny.
