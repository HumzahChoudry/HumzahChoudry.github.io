What did I just watch. Arsenal just had the worst game I have ever seen them play. This is including our annual stompdown from Bayer, every abismal Wenger vs Mourinho game, the opening day chokes, all of it. Arsenal just came out and limp dicked it on the field for 90 minutes. 

I have alway been a pretty loyal Wenger supporter. I've always believed in him and supported his style of managing. This shit today was undefendable. Why would you start Welbeck over your club record signing? Chamberlain has officially shown his disintrest in his future with the club by his defensive performance. Bellerin is a worse LB than Daley Blind if he were actually blind. First off, we have a LB on the bench, Kolsniac has been great every time he touches the field, yet we sit him. 

I was optimitic at the start of the season thinking if we could win the league Alexis would stay, Ozil would resign and we would see better days but it seems like no one even cares. So clear house. Sell Alexis, sell Chambo, sell Bellerin and anyone else who doesn't give half a shit to play. 

It's official to me, Arsenal is no longer a team that players want to be at and that breaks my heart more than anything. I'm so frustrated the words "Wenger out" are actually echoing in my head.
