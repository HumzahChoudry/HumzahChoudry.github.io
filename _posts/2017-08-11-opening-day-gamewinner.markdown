ALL HAIL, the Premier League is back! 

Game 1 was an instant classic. Back and forth with the home team winning in the final minutes.

If you havent hopped on the EPL train yet it's not too late. I love soccer. I truly think it would be a top 3 sport in the USA if everyone didn't assume all soccer players were floppers and most games end 0-0. I mean it's great, you wake up Saturday, get a cup of coffee, some breakfast during the first half and by the time the second half starts you're already killin beers. When the game is over it's a smooth transition into college football. Oh and did I mention that there arent any commercials. Well no commercial breaks at least, instead they just throw the advertisements on the jerseys and all around the field. Which is much better than when the NFL will have ads on the jerseys, helmets, gloves and jockstraps. Then they'll still cut to commercial everytime the play is whistled dead while Goodell swims in a money pool paid for by player fines.
