If you're an American soccer fan you know about Christian Pulisic. He's the best player we've got. He's the only one who starts for a champions league squad. Listen I try to not get too caught up in hype because of people like Freddy Adu and Jozy Altidore but, he's a baller. He's the first American since Clint Dempseys Fulham season to be playing undeniably well at an international level. 

Pulisic scored in the Dortmund season opener in which they won 3-0 over Wolfsburg. Now it's early in the season but if this kid stays the course he has Toni Kroos type potential. Here's an interview with him and a German reporter. How awesome is it to hear a soccer player with an American accent amiright? Especially after that comical beerfest accent he follows.
