So I've been looking for a job for a while now. After applying for thousands of positions, some of which I am overqualified for, most of which I am underqualified for. I have noticed that all job applications do this awkward thing. Let me know if this sounds familiar.

"We do not discriminate based on age race or gender"

Then they immediately ask you for you age race and gender.

Listen if I were on a date with a girl and she said "I dont care how much money you make...but who much money do you make" I would be a little suspicious. If it doesnt matter why ask? 

And I know they argument, it's for statistical purposes. So lets say the girl was like "Oh I really don't care how much you make, I just want to know what kind of guys are asking me out...you know where theyre from, how much money they have so that I can analyze it and figure out a way to change the demographic."

Uhh... I dont know what to say. I am sorry if I'm not your demographic miss, I however am a decent human being here to hopefully make you happy.
